    "# 1. The PriorityFloodFlowRouter.\n",
    "- Some landscape evolution models generate a large quantity of depressions over time and need to have an efficient algorithm to solve them and route flow, with reduced execution time.\n",
    "    - This is particularly the case with landslides, or glacial retreats and advances.\n",
    "- Faced to these large execution times with the DepressionFinderAndRouter, Benjamin Campforts developed the PriorityFloodFlowRouter with the CSDMS Team. This Component encapsulates the Richdem python package developed by Barnes. Richdem route flow based on the Priority Flood Flow algorithm detailed in [Barnes et al., 2014](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.01.009).\n",
    "    - The component combine the functionalities of flow directing, accumulation and depression filling.\n",
    "    - This algorithm works differently from the FlowDirectorSteepest and D8 combined with the DepressionFinderAndRouter:\n",
    "```    \n",
    "Use a different scanning, starting from the open boundary of the grid.\n",
    "Not stricto sensu steepest descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breach algorithm to handle depressions.\n",
    "Use the notion of depression outlets. If there's no depression, this depression outler is identic to the catchment outlet.\n",
    "Add a layer called depression_free_elevations, which fills the depressions of the topography\n",
    "\n",
    "- we create a total order priority queue called To_do, with initially no elements. We will add nodes into To_do ordered by elevation. This means that we will handle the nodes in To_do by popping the node with lowest elevation first.\n",
    "- we start from the nodes of the open boundary of the grid:\n",
    "    - we add them into To_do.\n",
    "    - we set their receivers as themselves.\n",
    "    - we set their catchment outlets and depression outlets as themselves too.\n",
    "    - we consider them as Done.\n",
    "- Then, we execute this while the To_do queue has nodes:\n",
    "    - we popped the node R with lowest elevation from the To_do queue.\n",
    "    - For all the neighbors of this node R, which have not been Done:\n",
    "        - we set them as donors of this node R (R then become their receiver).\n",
    "        - we set their catchment outlet and depression outlet to the cathment outlet and depression outlet of the node R.\n",
    "        - we set their depression_free_elevation:\n",
    "            - if their elevation is below the depression outlet, set to the elevation of the depression outlet.\n",
    "            - otherwise \n",
    "        - we add them to the To_do queue.\n",
    "    - we set the node R as Done.\n",
