Diagonals are included by default for RasterModelGrids. The final outlet of the catchments are always a base-level perimeter node, because the FlowRouter component breach depressions.\n",
    "    - the DepressionFinderAndRouter works differently from the FlowRouter. The DepressionFinderAndRouter scans all the sinks. These sinks are provided by the FlowDirector/Accumulator (field ```flow__sink_flag```). The component then maps depressions and finds the lowest node at the perimeter of the depression. Once found, it considers this point as the depression outlet and recalculates all flow directions and accumulations by evacuating the depression.\n",

    "    - The FlowRouter handles the depressions and calculates the single-to-single flow directions at the same time. For this, the component starts from the base-level nodes (with status fixed value or fixed gradient) and constructs a flow path by overcoming the depressions. It ensures that peaks remain peaks by always handling nodes with the lowest elevation first. By default for rasters, the component also diagonals (this option can be modified by the argument ```diagonals=False```).\n",

    "    - The flows are directed differently from the DepressionFinderAndRouter because the algorithms are different. The FlowRouter algorithm starts from base-level nodes to construct the paths by simultaneously solving the depressions (this is the **priority flood flow algorithm**).
