The FlowDirectorSteepest component uses a version of this loop (1) translated in C-language using Cython and (2) compiled when you install Landlab. Loops are performant in C because data access in arrays do not use objects as in python. So the FlowDirectorSteepest component works similarly to methods of the Numpy package, which similarly encapsulates C-code within python wrappers to optimize classic handling of arrays operations.\n",
